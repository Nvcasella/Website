    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Nicholas Casella. I am 20 years old and currently a full-time student at Marywood University, majoring in Information Security. I am passionate about technology, sports, and gaming, and I enjoy learning new skills both in and out of the classroom. 
        I played soccer for about 6 years of my life going to two championships and winning only once. I really enjoy cooking for my family because i was inspired from my grandfather to cook like him.

    <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
        I love sports and am very passionate about video games, especially titles like <strong>Call of Duty</strong> and <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. When it comes to movies, I am a huge fan of <strong>Star Wars</strong>, <strong>Marvel</strong>, and <strong>The Bourne series</strong>. Cooking is another hobby of mine; I was inspired by my mother, who taught me the joy of creating delicious meals. I also played soccer for 6 years, during which I went to the championship a few times and won twice!
